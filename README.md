- Teacher Management: Similar to student management, this module allows managing teacher records.
- Department Management: Enables adding, updating, and deleting department information.
- Course Management: Provides functionalities for adding, updating, and deleting course details.
- Enrollment Management: Facilitates enrolling students in courses and managing course enrollments.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Database Management System: MySQL
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): SQLAlchemy
- Web Framework (Optional): Flask or Django (if a web interface is desired)

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The following entities will be included in the ERD:

- Student: Contains information about students such as student ID, name, date of birth, etc.
